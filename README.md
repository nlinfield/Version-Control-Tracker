How to run:
Go into the directory where the python script is (where compare_files.py is).

Then run:
python compare_files.py old_file new_file with old_file being the first file you want to compare and new_file being the second file you want to compare.
If the files are in different directories, add the proper way to get to the files you want to test (like file_name/old_file).

If you want to use code or prose mode:
Do the above, but at the end, add:
--mode code/prose

Depending on which one you want to run.

You need Python installed to run.
